                        <p class="lead mb-4">EssayPrompt.org offers a money-back guarantee policy. This gives a client the right to request a refund in case our service fails to fulfill our duties. We want to emphasize we offer a full refund only in the following situations:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>If no expert has been assigned your academic writing assignment. We will refund the full amount including the fees charged. If such a situation occurs, we will notify you immediately.</li>
                            <li>If you want a refund when we have already assigned your order, you wonâ€™t get a full refund. In this case, we will deduct up to 50% to cover the effort our experts made in their attempt to write your paper. </li>
                            <li>We will offer you a full refund in case your paper is delivered late. However, if we slightly miss your deadline, we will refund an appropriate amount to compensate for the late delivery. We will discuss the exact amount with you. </li>
                            <li>We will offer you a full refund in case your paper is delivered late. However, if we slightly miss your deadline, we will refund an appropriate amount to compensate for the late delivery. We will discuss the exact amount with you. </li>
                            <li>We also offer refunds when dispute claims are filed. For instance, if you are not satisfied with your paper after a couple of revisions, we will refund up to 70% of your money. </li>
                            <li>We also offer a full refund in case of accidental duplicate orders. You need to contact us if you want to cancel a duplicate order. </li>
                            <li>We offer a full refund if the paper is plagiarized. A plagiarism report is required for any refund to be issued. </li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>You are not entitled to a refund if:</h3>

                        <ul>
                            <li>You received a lower grade than what was expected.</li>
                            <li>You miss a deadline due to failure to download the paper delivered before the deadline you set when placing an order. </li>
                            <li>If you claim that paper was plagiarized without providing proof (a plagiarism report). </li>
                            <li>If you fail to cancel a duplicate order or notify our support team to cancel the order before assigning it to our academic writing expert. </li>
                        
                        </ul>
